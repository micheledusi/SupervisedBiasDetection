# This module contains a class used to extract embeddings from a word.
# The class has a core method, called "embed", which takes a word as input (along with some other inputs) and returns the embedding of the word.
# The embedding is a vector of floats, instanced as a PyTorch tensor.
# This process can be done in different ways, depending on what the user wants to do.

		This method initializes the class.

			If the value is "-1", all the templates will be selected. The selection is done randomly. 
			By default, it will select all the templates.

			- ``average_templates``: whether to average the embeddings of each template or not, for a single word.
			By default, it will average the embeddings (i.e. the value is True).

			- ``average_tokens``: whether to average the embeddings of each token or not, for a single word.
			Note: we don't know in advance if the word will be split into multiple tokens.
			By default, it will average the embeddings (i.e. the value is True).

			- ``max_tokens_number``: the maximum number of tokens to consider for a single word.
			By default, it will consider all the tokens (i.e. the value is "-1").
