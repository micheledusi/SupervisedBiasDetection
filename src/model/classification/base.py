# This module contains a class representing a classifier, that is, a model that can be trained and used to predict a variable value.
# In our case, the model infers the value of a protected property from the embedding of a word (e.g. the vector in output to the NLP model).
# 
# An example of classificaiton used in our project is the one that predicts the <gender> of a word from its embedding:
# The <gender> is a protected property, for which we consider the values "male" and "female" among the possible values.
# After training the model on a dataset of words, for which we know the <gender> value, we can use the model to predict
# the <gender> value of new words, given their embedding.
